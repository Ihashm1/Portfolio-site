# Personal Portfolio Website (PHP-based)

This is a local PHP website developed using XAMPP. It showcases my personal projects and web development work.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements
- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Download and install XAMPP.
2. Open the `htdocs` folder in your XAMPP installation directory.
3. Copy or move the entire `portfolio` folder from this repository into `htdocs`.
4. Start **Apache** and **SQL** from the XAMPP Control Panel.
5. In your browser, go to:  
   `http://localhost/portfolio`

My portfolio website should now load locally.
